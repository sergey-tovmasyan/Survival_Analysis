# Survival_Analysis
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation and Findings:

The CLV was calculated per customer using the final LogNormal Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model. The survival functions predicted by the model were adjusted for discounting, and CLV was derived by summing the discounted revenues over time. Further exploration was conducted within different customer segments, revealing variations in CLV. Valuable segments were defined as those with higher CLV, indicating a greater potential for revenue generation over a customer's lifetime.

Interpretation of Coefficients, Identification of Valuable Segments, Annual Retention Budget

The coefficients from the final model were interpreted to understand their impact on churn risk. Key factors influencing churn risk included customer age, marital status, internet usage, education level, and voice service subscription.
Valuable segments were identified based on their CLV, with a focus on those exhibiting higher survival probabilities. These segments typically comprised customers with longer tenures, specific marital statuses, education levels, and service subscriptions. Understanding these valuable segments allows for targeted retention strategies to maximize revenue.
The annual retention budget was estimated by analyzing the CLV and survival probabilities to identify the number of at-risk subscribers within a year. This budget represents the investment needed to retain customers at risk of churning, ensuring sustained revenue streams.
